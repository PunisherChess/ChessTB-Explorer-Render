/**
 * board.js — Chessground wrapper
 *
 * Wraps the vendor Chessground() instance and a chess.js game-state object,
 * and owns:
 *   - A branching move tree (_nodes/_rootChildren) used by the PGN panel:
 *     playing a move after navigating back adds a variation instead of
 *     overwriting whatever previously continued from that point. A plain
 *     undo/redo FEN stack (_history/_future) sits alongside it as a
 *     fallback for Back/Forward once navigation walks off the tree (e.g.
 *     past a board edit that started a fresh one).
 *   - Best-move arrows for DTZ/DTM/DTM50, drawn via chessground's native
 *     drawable.autoShapes.
 *   - Click-to-place editing: click a spare piece, then click a square to
 *     place it. Drag-from-tray is also supported (chessground's
 *     dragNewPiece()).
 *   - goToNode() — jump to any node in the *current* move tree (used by
 *     the PGN panel, including variation moves) without resetting the tree
 *     or re-triggering a probe for a position that's already been evaluated.
 *   - Board/piece theming: the piece image path is owned by theme.js
 *     (Theme.pieceThemeFn()). reconstruct(pieceThemeFn) updates the piece
 *     CSS <link> and repopulates the spare-tray/promotion-dialog images;
 *     chessground never needs to be destroyed and rebuilt for a piece-set
 *     change, since piece images are plain CSS.
 *
 * Every position-changing action — setPosition(), clear(), playMove(),
 * goBack()/goForward(), board edits (off-board drop, board-setup drag,
 * click-to-place) — records itself (in the tree or the undo/redo stack,
 * whichever applies) and invokes the onPositionChange callback itself, so
 * callers never need to remember to do either one manually.
 *
 * chess.js (via _game) remains the single source of truth for
 * position/legality — chessground is a dumb, controlled rendering surface.
 * Every position-changing function ends with a call to _syncChessground(),
 * which pushes _game's current FEN (plus turn colour, check state, and
 * last-move squares) into chessground in one shot. The core mutation
 * handler (_handleBoardMutation) is written to be idempotent rather than
 * tracking which of chessground's several event hooks handled a given user
 * action, because chessground fires multiple, differently-scoped events for
 * what is logically one move — see the comment above events.move's wiring
 * in init() for the actual firing order this relies on: for an ordinary
 * relocation, chessground's own events.move fires first, then
 * events.change, then movable.events.after (confirmed directly from
 * chessground's source, not a timing flake — see board.ts's
 * baseMove()/userMove()). events.change carries no orig/dest, so if it won
 * the idempotency race it would take the generic "board edit" branch and
 * leave movable.events.after's orig/dest with nothing left to act on.
 * Wiring events.move as the primary handler avoids that: it fires before
 * events.change and, unlike movable.events.after, carries orig/dest (plus
 * capture info), so it reliably wins the idempotency race with enough
 * information to classify the move correctly. events.change and
 * movable.events.after stay wired as idempotent fallbacks, since neither
 * can fire before events.move for a relocation, and events.change remains
 * the only hook that fires at all for an off-board deletion (drag.ts's
 * deleteOnDropOff branch calls it directly, with no accompanying
 * events.move/movable.events.after).
