"""Random-access byte source for chesstb tables served over plain HTTP,
via ``Range`` requests, instead of a local filesystem.

This module has no chesstb-specific logic of its own -- it's a generic
HTTP byte-range client -- and lives in remote/ as shared infrastructure
for remote (URL) ``TABLEBASE_PATH`` support, used by both remote backends
app.py can select via ``config.REMOTE_MODE`` (see each file's module
docstring for its own design):

* remote/remote_direct.py ("direct", the default) probes tables in place,
  reading through :class:`RemoteFileView` below so only the byte ranges a
  probe actually touches are ever fetched.
* remote/remote_fallback.py ("download") downloads each table file in
  full on first touch and disk-caches it, using only
  :class:`RemoteHTTPClient`, :class:`RemoteFile`, and :class:`_PageCache`
  from this module.

Design
------
* :class:`RemoteHTTPClient` -- a thin ``requests.Session`` wrapper that
  knows how to ask "does `<base_url>/<path>` exist, and how big is it?"
  and "give me bytes [offset, offset+length) of `<base_url>/<path>`", and
  keeps a running count of every HTTP request it issues and every
  response byte it receives, available via :meth:`RemoteHTTPClient.stats`.
  Its session mounts an ``HTTPAdapter`` sized to the caller's expected
  concurrency (``pool_maxsize``, normally set from ``PROBE_THREADS``) so
  concurrent requests reuse warm connections instead of opening fresh
  ones once the default pool is exhausted, and its retry loop backs off
  between attempts -- honoring a ``Retry-After`` header when the server
  sends one -- rather than retrying instantly into a struggling or
  rate-limiting CDN edge.
* :class:`_PageCache` -- a sharded LRU cache, shared by every table opened
  against one remote base URL, of fixed-size raw page fetches. A page's
  key is hashed to one of a fixed number of independent shards -- each
  with its own lock, LRU ledger, per-key fetch lock, and slice of the
  overall byte budget -- so concurrent reads of pages that land in
  different shards never contend on a single mutex. This is what makes
  the hot path fast: a table's index structures (consulted on every
  single probe) do many small, scattered reads clustered in a fairly
  small region of each table file, so after the first probe touches a
  region its page is cached and every later probe against the same table
  is served with no network round trip at all. Each shard also tracks its
  own hit/miss counts, summed by :attr:`_PageCache.hits` /
  :attr:`_PageCache.misses` for the whole cache.
* :class:`RemoteFile` -- one opened remote table (fixed client + path +
  size), with a ``read(offset, length)`` that satisfies a request from
  the shared page cache, fetching only whichever pages aren't already
  resident.
* :class:`RemoteFileView` -- a lightweight ``(RemoteFile, base, length)``
  view supporting the same slicing/indexing a local
  ``memoryview(mmap(...))`` buffer would. Slicing a view is *free* -- it
  never touches the network, just narrows the (base, length) window.
  Only an explicit materialisation (``bytes(view)``, iterating it, or
  indexing a single byte) triggers a fetch, and only for the span
  actually needed. This is what remote_direct.py probes through.
