"""Byte-range ChessTB tablebase access: probe remote tables *in place*,
fetching only the bytes each probe touches.

How this differs from remote_fallback.py
----------------------------------------
remote_fallback.py downloads a whole table file on first touch and hands
the standard ``WDLFile``/``DTZFile``/``DTCFile``/``DTMFile``/``DTM50File``
a local path. This module instead uses those same classes' ability to read
through any buffer-shaped object: ``chess.chesstb._TableFile._open_source``
is the documented seam for it, and ``chess.chesstb.Tablebase.WDL_FILE`` /
``.DTZ_FILE`` / ``.DTC_FILE`` / ``.DTM_FILE`` / ``.DTM50_FILE`` name the
classes carrying the override, so this module never has to reimplement the
look-once-then-cache logic in ``_open_wdl`` and friends.

This module connects that seam to :class:`remote_source.RemoteFileView`:
``_find`` resolves a material to a :class:`remote_source.RemoteFile`
rather than downloading it, ``_open_source`` wraps that in a lazy view,
and the table's header parse plus each probe's block reads pull only
their own byte ranges through the shared page cache. A material's first
touch fetches its existence, size, and first page together in one round
trip (see ``_remote_size`` / :meth:`remote_source.RemoteHTTPClient.get_first_page`)
and seeds the page cache with it, since the header parse that runs
immediately afterward needs exactly that page next anyway.

Trade-off against remote_fallback.py
------------------------------------
Cold cost is "a handful of 256 KiB pages" rather than "one full table
download", and ``REMOTE_PAGE_CACHE_BYTES`` bounds memory only -- nothing
is written to disk here at all.

The cost is per-read CPU. Against a mapping, the hot 8-byte bit-window
read (:func:`chess.chesstb._read_u64le`) is a C-level ``unpack_from``;
here every one of them is a Python call into
:meth:`remote_source.RemoteFile.read` -> a dict lookup and a slice, even
on a page-cache hit. So this backend wins decisively while a session
ranges over many materials (the common case for an explorer: most tables
are touched a few times each) and loses to remote_fallback.py once a
single material is probed hard enough that the download amortizes. Both
are kept; config.py's ``REMOTE_MODE`` chooses.

Per-material opening
---------------------
``chess.chesstb.Tablebase`` normally guards each *kind*'s first-open dance
(``_open_wdl``/``_open_dtz``/``_open_dtc``/``_open_dtm``/``_open_dtm50``)
with one lock per kind, shared by every material of that kind -- cheap to
hold for a local ``os.path.exists()``, but this class's ``_find`` does a
real network round trip underneath it. So ``_RemoteTablebase`` overrides
all five ``_open_*`` methods to lock per ``(kind, material)`` instead of
per kind, using the same double-checked-locking shape
:class:`remote_source._PageCache` already uses for per-page fetch locks:
two threads racing to open the *same* material still collapse onto one
fetch, but two threads opening *different* materials of the same kind no
longer serialize behind each other's round trip.
